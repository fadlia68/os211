### Top 10 Weekly List (Week8)

1. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling][1]<br>
This article explains about two types of CPU scheduling, there are preemptive and non-preemptive. There are provided some key differents about the two types so i can understand it faster.

2. [Scheduling][2]<br>
I choose this link because i am interested in how the process manager handles the running process from the CPU. So i think it is a fine website to me for learning some terms such as PCB, two-stata process model, context switch, etc.

3. [OS Policies][3]<br>
Related to this week's topics, i found video about operating system policies for virtual memory. This video is one of the video in the playlist of "Memory Management in OS" so i can watch the other related videos later.

4. [Processes][4]<br>
I like this website because it explains the overview of a program in execution which then forms the basis of all computation. Other than that there are also explanation about sections, states, and the difference between process and program.

5. [Threads][5]<br>
This link contains references about threads in general and its libraries & modules. The website also contains the illustration and the source code to complement the explanation.

6. [Deadlines][6]<br>
This article explains how the deadlines works in operating system completely. The explanation is divided into some parts such as definitions, limitations, advantages, problems, etc.

7. [Real-Time in OS][7]<br>
I choose this link because there is explanation about real-time operating system (RTOS). This website is very complete for me so i would recommend this article to some of my friends.

8. [CPU and I/O Burst][8]<br>
Related to several links above, i also discover a video about CPU and I/O Burst Cycles from Neso Academy. I like this video because the explanation is very clear, also the reviews from many people is very good.

9. [Utilization][9]<br>
I like this website because it contains simple overview of CPU utilization. This website is quite simple so maybe it just take less than one minute to read it.

10. [System Contention Scope][10]<br>
This link contains the outline of multithreaded programming, especially about LWP (Light-Weight Process) and SCS (System Contention Scope). It is also has an illustration about how some states work in OS; the states are stopped, runnable, sleeping, active, and zombie.
