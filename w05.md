### Top 10 Weekly List (Week5)

1. [Physical Memory][1]<br>
I choose this link because there is explanation about a very fast memory, but volatile data storage. This link also contains how to optionally reduce your physical memory if you want.

2. [Thrashing][2]<br>
This website is appropiate for someone who need a larger space for his RAM. I like this website because it also explain about page fault and swapping in OS.

3. [Virtual Memory][3]<br>
Related to memory, i found this video about beginning explanation of virtual memory. I recommend this video because the channel also has other videos that related to memory in OS.
 
4. [Demand Paging][4]<br>
I like this website because it contains technique in virtual memory that the pages are used only when demanded by CPU. Besides demand paging, there are also contents about pre-paging. 

5. [Page Fault][5]<br>
This article explains why and when the "page fault" occurs in your operating system. And then i just realized that they dont form like an error, but they are common thing and part of the normal way computers handle virtual memory.

6. [Copy on Write][6]<br>
This article explains a technique that to efficiently copy data resources in a computer system. This article also provide link to the other article of data deduplication.

7. [Page Replacement Algorithm][7]<br>
I like this website because it contains simple explanation about concept of page replacement in memory management. Also there are explanations about types of page replacement such as FIFO, LRU, and optimal page replacement. 

8. [LRU Implementation][8]<br>
Related to page replacement, this video will teach us what is LRU algorithm. In this video there are also explanation about what is page fault, page hit, and disadvantages of LRU.

9. [Belady Anomaly][9]<br>
I choose this link because there is explanation about what is beladys anomaly in virtual memory. This link also contains visualization about the content so it is very easy to understand.

10. [Slab Allocation][10]<br>
This website is appropiate to someone who want to know about an object-caching-kernel deeply. I like the website because it also provide the source and the implementation so i can learn more about it.
