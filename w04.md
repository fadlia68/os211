### Top 10 Weekly List (Week3)

1. [Linux Libraries][1]<br>
This article explains how shared libraries work in linux. There are many types of libraries such as libc, glibc, libcurl, libcrypt, etc.

2. [Endianness][2]<br>
I like this website because it contains simple explanation about endianness in computer science. Also there are explanations about byte, LSB, MSB, issues with endianness, etc. 

3. [Hardware Protection][3]<br>
I choose this link because there are some descriptions about protection in hardware things. The hardware protection divided into three categories, that is CPU, memory, and I/O protection.

4. [Endianness Explained With An Egg???][4]<br>
Yes, if you want to learn out-of-the-box idea about endianness, you should watch this video. The content is easy to understand and (maybe because(?)) it is explained by a doctoral lecturer from University of Nottingham.

5. [Address Binding][5]<br>
This website is appropiate to someone who want to know how addresses work in computer memory. I like this website because it also explain about compile, load, and execution time.

6. [Dynamic Linking][6]<br>
I choose this link because there are some explanation about what the ability of compiling and linking code. This link also contains little sneak peek about callable IDL program

7. [Pointers and Addresses in C][7]<br>
Related to C/C++ language, this video explains how the pointers work with memory addresses. The visualization and presentation is very good so i would like recommend it to my friends.

8. [Memory Management Unit][8]<br>
This website explain what is memory management unit in general. It also offers some other links about MMU if you want to know further.
 
9. [Base and Limit Register][9]<br>
I like this website because it contains pdf file about base and limit register in OS with the visualization. Also there are explanations about internal and external fragmentation.

10. [Contiguous Allocation][10]<br>
This article explains how to allocate a single contiguous section of memory to a process or a file. The content divided into 5 section, there are memory allocation, memory management, fragmentation, advanteges and disadvantages, and key takeaways.
