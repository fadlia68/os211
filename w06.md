### Top 10 Weekly List (Week6)

1. [Concurrency][1]<br>
I choose this link because i am interested at learning concurrency in operating system. So i think it is a good website to me for learning the definition, principle, problems, and issues about it.

2. [Process States][2]<br>
This article explains in general the states and the operations of the process that happening in OS. There are seven states such as new, ready, running, etc. and there are four operations such as creation, scheduling, execution, and deletion.

3. [Context Switching][3]<br>
Related to embedded systems, every CPU has a process named context switching. I recommend this video because the explanation is clear and easy to understand.

4. [Process Control Block][4]<br>
This link contains the definition about process control block (PCB), process management, and the other process in os. CPU Registers and program counter are two of the important components of PCB.

5. [Role of Interrupts][5]<br>
I like this website because it explains basic of how opearting systems work in general. There are some images that can illustrate the explanation well.

6. [Synchronization Primitives][6]<br>
This link contains the overview of synchronization primitives and threading objects and features. It is also has continuous article to the related topics such as EventWaitHandle, CountdownEvent, Mutexes, etc.

7. [Spin Locks][7]<br>
I choose this link because there is explanation about spin lock in operating system. This website is quite simple so maybe it just takes less than one minute to read it.

8. [Fork System Call][8]<br>
The video in this link explain about how fork() works in our program. This video is very helpful for me to understand this week's topics (W06).

9. [Process Identification][9]<br>
I like this website because it contains documentation about data type and function of process identification (PID). Related to this topics, there are also some link to other docs such as creating a process and process creation concepts.

10. [Multiprocessing vs Multithreading][10]<br>
This article explains the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading especially in phyton language. There are also some snippet code and illustration so i can understand the content well.
