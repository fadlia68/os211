### Top 10 Weekly List (Week7)

1. [Shared Memory][1]<br>
I like this website because it explains the overview of shared memory between two or more processors. There are some example codes for compilation and execution steps so i can try it on my own computer.

2. [Critical Section][2]<br>
This article explains in general about critical section problem in OS. There are four solution to this problem such as mutual exclusion, progress, bounded waiting, and architectural neutrality.

3. [Synchronization][3]<br>
Related to this week's topics, i found video about synchronization process. Beside that there are many links provided in the video's description that are very useful to search other references.

4. [Message Passing][4]<br>
This link contains lecture file from Princeton University about MessagePassing. The file also contains the examples of this topic such as mailbox, socket, MPI, and RPC.

5. [Precision Time Protocol][5]<br>
I choose this link because i am interested at configuring PTP over ethernet in many ways. So i think it is a good website to me for learning how to navigate various levels in the configuration hierarchy step by step.

6. [Race Condition][6]<br>
I choose this link because there is explanation about race condition and its definition in operating system. This website is quite simple so maybe it just takes less than five minutes to read and understand it.

7. [Semaphores][7]<br>
This link contains the overview of semaphores in process synchronization. It is also has continuous article to the related topics such as Inter Process Communication (IPC), Mutex, Monitors, etc.

8. [Process Synchronization][8]<br>
Related to several links above, i also discover a video that has same subject matter with it. I like this video because sometimes i prefer watching a video than reading an article.

9. [Bounded Buffer][9]<br>
I like this website because it contains discussion about bounded buffer problem and its solution. The solution also provided into two source pseudocode, there are producer and consumer operation.

10. [Dining Philosophers][10]<br>
This article explains the very well known resource sharing problem in the world of computers named Dining Philosophers Problem. The explanation also provided with some GIF illustration so i can understand the problem well and easily.
